# Configuring a network share to store attachments

<!--RN43726-->

Since DataMiner 10.5.10, users can specify a UNC path and select credentials from the Credentials Library to store DOM attachments linked to DOM Instances. 

By default, this feature is not enabled, and attachments are saved locally in the C:\Skyline DataMiner\Documents folder.

1. Make sure a correct credential of the type *Username and password credentials* is available in the Credential Library.

1. In the Automation app in DataMiner Cube, run the *DOM Editor* script. You can find this script in the folder `DOM\DOM Main scripts`.

   The script window will show a list of the available modules, as well as several buttons.

1. Next to the module for which you want configure a network share, click *Edit*.

   A window with four buttons will be displayed.

1. Click the button *Network Share Attachment Settingsâ€¦* to open a new page to configure the settings.

1. Select the correct credential from the *Credential* dropdown. If the expected credential is not available, verify if your account has permission to use the credential. 

1. In the *Network Share Path* box, fill in the UNC path to the network share. It needs to start with \\\\ and cannot contain any characters that are illegal for a path (e.g. "<") or strings that allow directory traversal (e.g. "../").

1. Click *Back* again and then click *Apply* and *OK*.

## Notes

- The configuration creates a [DomInstanceNetworkAttachmentSettings](xref:DOM_DomInstanceNetworkAttachmentSettings) object.
- Changes are applied immediately and do not require a restart.

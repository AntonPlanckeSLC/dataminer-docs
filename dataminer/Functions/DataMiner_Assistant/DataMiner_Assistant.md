# DataMiner Assistant

The DataMiner Assistant is an integrated AI assistant that helps you interact with your DataMiner System more efficiently. It can answer DataMiner-related questions and help you interpret and manage data from your system.

You can access the DataMiner Assistant via the [DataMiner landing page](xref:Accessing_the_web_apps#dataminer-landing-page).

The Assistant is available in two tabs, each designed for a specific type of interaction: the [*Insights* tab](#insights), where it analyzes live data from your system, and the [*Documentation* tab](#documentation), where it provides conceptual and procedural guidance based on the official documentation.

Together, these two tabs make the DataMiner Assistant a convenient way to access both system insights and reliable information.

## Insights

In the *Insights* tab, the Assistant has access to your DataMiner data and can analyze it on your behalf. It can provide summaries and detailed insights into elements, alarms, and other key components of your system.

For example, you can ask which alarms require immediate attention, and the Assistant will identify and prioritize them, providing possible resolution steps. This makes it easier to monitor system health and take timely action without manually going through large data sets.

## Documentation

In the *Documentation* tab, the Assistant focuses on conceptual and procedural questions. It has direct access to DataMiner Docs, allowing it to provide accurate and up-to-date information directly from the source.

You can ask questions such as how to configure an alarm template or how DataMiner user permissions work, and the Assistant will retrieve the relevant information for you. This allows you to find documentation content quickly without needing to browse through the site yourself.

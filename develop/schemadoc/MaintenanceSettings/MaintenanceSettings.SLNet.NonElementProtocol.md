# NonElementProtocol element

In a Visual Overview, a "NonElementProtocol" option can be specified in case it contains shapes linked to a large number of elements, but no element-specific formatting is needed from files like description.xml, information.xml, or port.xml. This can enhance the overall performance of the Visual Overview. It is also possible to apply this option system-wide, instead of limiting it to one Visual Overview shape or page. Default: false.

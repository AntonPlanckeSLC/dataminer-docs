## Changes

### Enhancements

#### User-defined APIs: New ResponseHeaders property [ID 43705]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.12 -->

In the `ResponseHeaders` property of the `ApiTriggerOutput` class, you can now specify the HTTP headers that will be added to the response.

Currently, the following headers are blocked, and will result in an error if you try to set them:

- Access-Control-Allow-Origin
- Access-Control-Allow-Credentials
- Access-Control-Expose-Headers
- Access-Control-Allow-Methods
- Access-Control-Max-Age
- Vary
- Content-Length (automatically set)
- Set-Cookie
- WWW-Authenticate
- Proxy-Authenticate
- Transfer-Encoding
- Connection
- Upgrade
- Trailer
- TE
- Via
- Server
- Date (automatically set)
- Strict-Transport-Security

The endpoint can now also return the following additional errors:

| ErrorCode | Integer value | HTTP Status Code | Description |
|-----------|---------------|------------------|-------------|
| ResponseHeadersNotAllowed | 1012 | 500 | The response header or headers you are trying to return are not allowed. |
| ResponseHeadersInvalid | 1013 | 500 | The response header or headers you are trying to return are invalid. Header names and values cannot contain whitespace, colons (":"), commas (","), or ASCII control characters. The *UserDefinableApiEndpoint* logging will contain the exact error. |

#### Automation, Correlation, and Scheduler: All dashboard reports will now fully be generated by the Web DcM [ID 43762]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, all dashboard reports configured in Automation, Correlation or Scheduler will fully be generated by the Web DcM. SLHelper will no longer be involved in any report generation processes.

SLHelper will also no longer convert the reports of the legacy Reporter module to PDF format. From now on, this will also be done by the Web DcM.

#### NATSMigration tool will now also check for outdated DLL files in the ProtocolScripts folder [ID 43778]

<!-- MR 10.6.0 - FR 10.5.12 -->

From now on, the *NATSMigration* tool will also check for outdated DLL files in the `C:\Skyline DataMiner\ProtocolScripts` folder.

When an outdated DLL file is found, the migration will be aborted. For the migration to succeed, the user will have to remove the outdated DLL file and update the protocol in question.

### Fixes

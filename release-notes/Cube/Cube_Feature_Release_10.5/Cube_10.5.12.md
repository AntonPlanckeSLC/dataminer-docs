### Fixes

#### Trend graph showing high-value predictions would not get updated when you scrolled the predictions beyond the viewport [ID 43776]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When you opened a trend graph showing trend data values with low Y values and predictions with very high Y values, up to now, the graph that resembled a flatline would incorrectly not get updated when you scrolled the predictions beyond the viewport.

#### Problem when switching themes while trend graphs were open [ID 43777]

<!-- MR 10.4.0 [CU21] / 10.5.0 [CU9] - FR 10.5.12 -->

When, in DataMiner Cube, you opened a trend graph and then switched to another theme, up to now, errors would start to appear in the logging.

Also, the trend graph colors would incorrectly not get updated.
